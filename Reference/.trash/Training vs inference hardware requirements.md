### Training vs. 🔍 Inference: Hardware Considerations

|Feature|Training|Inference|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Learn patterns from large datasets|Apply learned patterns to new data|
|**Hardware Needs**|High compute, high memory bandwidth, large batch sizes|Low latency, often lower power consumption|
|**Typical Devices**|High-end GPUs (e.g. NVIDIA A100, H100) or multi-GPU servers|Mid-range GPUs (e.g. T4, L4, A10), CPUs, edge accelerators|
|**Precision**|Often uses FP32 or mixed precision (FP16, BF16)|Often uses INT8 or FP16 for speed|
|**Batch Sizes**|Large (to maximize throughput)|Small or single-batch (to reduce latency)|
|**Duration**|Hours to days|Milliseconds per request|

### Why Not Use the Same Hardware?

- **Cost**: Training GPUs are much more expensive and overkill for inference.
- **Latency vs. Throughput**:
    - Training favors throughput (how much data can be processed over time).
    - Inference favors low latency (how fast you get a prediction).
- **Power and Heat**: Training burns more power; inference can run on smaller, cooler setups—even on mobile or edge devices.
