**Karpenter** is an **open-source Kubernetes cluster autoscaler** developed by **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**. It dynamically **provisions and manages worker nodes (compute capacity)** in response to the actual needs of workloads running in a Kubernetes cluster.

While the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler is the traditional solution for scaling nodes, **Karpenter is designed to be faster, more flexible, and cloud-optimized**.
