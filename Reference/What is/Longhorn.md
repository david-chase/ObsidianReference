**Longhorn** is an **open-source distributed block storage system** designed for **Kubernetes**. It provides persistent storage for containers by managing volumes across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.

It was originally developed by **Rancher Labs** (now part of SUSE) and is particularly known for being **lightweight, cloud-native, and easy to use for Kubernetes persistent storage**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Longhorn:

### 1. **Distributed Block Storage**:

- Longhorn creates **replicated block storage volumes** across multiple Kubernetes nodes.
    
- If a node fails, data remains available from other replicas.
    

### 2. **Cloud-Native & Kubernetes Native**:

- Fully integrated with Kubernetes using **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**.
    
- Manages volumes through standard Kubernetes APIs.
    

### 3. **Snapshots & Backups**:

- Supports **instant snapshots** for volume backups.
    
- Backups can be stored in external object storage (e.g., S3-compatible services).
    

### 4. **UI Dashboard**:

- Provides an intuitive web-based UI to manage volumes, replicas, and backups.
    

### 5. **Thin Provisioning & Incremental Snapshots**:

- Efficient storage usage.
    
- Snapshots and backups are incremental to minimize storage overhead.
    

### 6. **Self-Healing & Data Recovery**:

- Automatically rebuilds replicas if a node goes down.
    
- Ensures high availability of data.
    

### 7. **Supports Edge and On-Prem Clusters**:

- Popular in edge, on-prem, and hybrid Kubernetes deployments.
    
- Lightweight footprint compared to traditional storage solutions.
