**Spring Boot** is an open-source framework built on top of the **Spring Framework**, designed to simplify the process of creating stand-alone, production-ready Java applications with minimal setup.

### Key Features:

1. **Auto-Configuration**  
    Automatically configures Spring and third-party libraries based on the project’s dependencies.
    
2. **Standalone Applications**  
    Creates applications that can run independently without needing a full application server (e.g., Tomcat is embedded).
    
3. **Opinionated Defaults**  
    Provides sensible defaults to reduce boilerplate code and setup time.
    
4. **Production-Ready Features**  
    Includes metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration to help prepare apps for deployment.
    
5. **Spring Boot Starter Dependencies**  
    Bundles commonly used libraries into single dependencies to make dependency management easier.
    
6. **Embedded Servers**  
    Supports embedded web servers like **Tomcat**, **Jetty**, or **Undertow**, so you don’t need to deploy to a separate server.
    
7. **Actuator**  
    Offers a set of built-in endpoints for monitoring and managing the application.
