**Kayenta** is an **open-source automated canary analysis (ACA) platform** developed by **Netflix**. It is designed to help teams **automatically assess the health of new software deployments** by comparing them against a baseline (usually a stable version) before shifting production traffic fully.

Kayenta is part of the **Spinnaker continuous delivery platform**, but it can also be used independently.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Canary Analysis?

- A **canary deployment** involves rolling out a new version of an application to a small subset of users or servers first.
    
- **Automated Canary Analysis (ACA)** evaluates the performance, error rates, and other metrics of the new version ("canary") against the current stable version ("baseline").
    
- The goal is to **detect potential issues early**, before affecting the entire user base.

- Uses **statistical methods** to assess if the canary is healthy.
    
- Can automatically **approve, fail, or require manual intervention** based on analysis results.
    
- Supports integration with **Spinnaker pipelines** and external metric providers.
