**Kubrix** is a commercial platform for automating the deployment and lifecycle management of complex applications in Kubernetes environments. It focuses on providing **intent-based automation**, integrating GitOps principles, and supporting modular application composition via reusable templates and blueprints.

It aims to simplify managing distributed, multi-cluster Kubernetes applications by automating low-level details like CRDs, operators, Helm charts, and environment-specific differences. Kubrix targets teams looking for a more scalable and standardized approach to Kubernetes platform engineering and application delivery.
