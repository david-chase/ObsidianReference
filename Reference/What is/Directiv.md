**Direktiv** is an **open-source, event-driven workflow engine** built for **Kubernetes** and cloud-native environments. It enables teams to orchestrate complex business logic and automation workflows using **serverless containers** and a declarative YAML-based syntax. Direktiv is designed for **event-based**, scalable, and low-latency automation—ideal for microservices, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps pipelines.

    - Track data across workflow runs, handle retries, conditions, parallelism, and looping logic.
- ⚡ **Event-Driven Execution**
    - Trigger workflows via webhooks, events, API calls, or external systems.
- 🐳 **Kubernetes-Native**
    - Designed to run in Kubernetes using standard CRDs and leveraging container lifecycle primitives.
