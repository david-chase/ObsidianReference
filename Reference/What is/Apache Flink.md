### ðŸ”¹ Key Features

- **Unified Stream and Batch Processing**: Flink provides a single runtime for both stream and batch processing, allowing developers to build applications that can handle real-time data streams and historical data sets seamlessly.â€‹
    
- **Event-Time Processing**: Flink supports event-time semantics, enabling accurate and consistent processing of events based on their timestamps, which is crucial for out-of-order data.â€‹
    
- **Stateful Computations**: Flink allows applications to maintain state across events, supporting complex event processing and enabling features like aggregations, joins, and pattern matching over time.â€‹
    
- **Fault Tolerance**: With its checkpointing mechanism, Flink provides exactly-once state consistency guarantees, ensuring that applications can recover from failures without data loss.â€‹
    
- **Scalability**: Flink is designed to scale horizontally and can handle large-scale data processing workloads efficiently.
