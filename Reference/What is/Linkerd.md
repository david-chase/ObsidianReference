**Linkerd** is an **open-source service mesh** designed to provide **observability, reliability, and security** for microservices in **Kubernetes clusters**.

It manages **service-to-service communication** by handling things like **mTLS encryption, traffic routing, retries, timeouts, and metrics collection** â€” all without requiring changes to your application code.

Unlike Istio, which is feature-rich but complex, **Linkerd focuses on simplicity, performance, and ease of use**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Linkerd?

- A **lightweight service mesh** specifically designed for **Kubernetes environments**.
    
- Adds **zero-trust security, observability, and resilience** features between services.
    
- Uses a **sidecar proxy pattern** (ultra-light Rust-based data plane).
    
- Focuses on being **simple, fast, and secure by default**.
