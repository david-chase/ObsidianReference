**Gang scheduling** is a **parallel job scheduling technique** used to ensure that a group of related tasks (a _gang_) are scheduled to run **simultaneously on multiple processors or nodes**. It is most common in **high-performance computing (HPC)** and **AI/ML training workloads** that require tightly coupled processes (e.g., MPI jobs).

In essence:

> Either _all_ tasks in a gang start together, or _none_ start at all.

This prevents inefficiencies caused when part of a distributed job starts while other parts are still waiting for resources.

### üß© **Key Concepts**

- **Gang (Job Group):**  
    A set of interdependent tasks or pods that must run together for meaningful progress.
- **All-or-Nothing Scheduling:**  
    Resources are only allocated if all tasks in the gang can be scheduled simultaneously.
   - **Synchronization:**  
    Tasks in a gang often communicate frequently, so running them at the same time reduces idle time and network latency.
- **Fairness Across Gangs:**  
    The scheduler cycles between gangs to share CPU/GPU clusters equitably across multi-tenant workloads.

### üí° **In Kubernetes**

Gang scheduling is not part of native Kubernetes, but it‚Äôs implemented by several **custom schedulers and frameworks**, including:

- **Volcano:**  
    A popular Kubernetes batch and HPC scheduler that implements gang scheduling natively.
- **[Kubeflow Training Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator):**  
    Can leverage gang scheduling through Volcano for distributed AI training.
- **[Kube-batch (legacy project):**  
    Early implementation that evolved into Volcano.

### üß† **Use Cases**

- **HPC workloads (MPI, OpenMP, TensorFlow, PyTorch)**
- **Large-scale deep learning training (multi-GPU jobs)**
- **Scientific simulations and distributed analytics**

---
### üîç **Advantages**

- Ensures fairness and predictability for tightly coupled workloads.
- Reduces wasted CPU/GPU cycles from partially scheduled jobs.
- Improves performance consistency for parallel applications.

---
### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Drawbacks**

- Can lead to **lower cluster utilization** if waiting for enough free resources.
- Complex to integrate with **elastic** or **autoscaling** environments.
- May not suit **embarrassingly parallel** jobs that don‚Äôt require synchronization.
