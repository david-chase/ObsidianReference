A **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)** is a type of **application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)** developed by **Google** specifically to **accelerate machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** workloads. Unlike CPUs and GPUs, which are general-purpose processors, TPUs are **optimized for tensor (matrix) operations**, which are at the core of neural network computation â€” especially for frameworks like **TensorFlow**.

ðŸ‘‰ **TPUs are used for both AI training _and_ inference**, but **training** has become their **primary use case** in recent years.
