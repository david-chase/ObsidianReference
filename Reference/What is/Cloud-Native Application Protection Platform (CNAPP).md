### ðŸ§© What CNAPP Combines

A CNAPP consolidates several security tools into one integrated solution, typically including:

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**CSPM** (Cloud Security Posture Management)|Detects cloud misconfigurations and enforces best practices (e.g., AWS S3 open buckets).|
|**CWPP** (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)|Protects workloads like VMs, containers, serverless functions at runtime.|
|**CIEM** (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management)|Manages and analyzes permissions/entitlements to reduce identity risk.|
|**SCA** (Software Composition Analysis)|Detects vulnerabilities in dependencies (open-source libraries, container images).|
|**IaC Scanning**|Analyzes infrastructure-as-code for security issues before deployment.|
|**SBOM + CVE Detection**|Builds Software Bill of Materials and flags known vulnerabilities.|
