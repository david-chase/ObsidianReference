Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform that provides comprehensive security coverage, from left to right across the entire development and deployment lifecycle. It offers hardening, posture management, and runtime security capabilities to ensure robust protection for Kubernetes environments.

_Key features of Kubescape include_

- **Shift-left security**: Kubescape enables developers to scan for misconfigurations as early as the manifest file submission stage, promoting a proactive approach to security.
- **Runtime security**: Kubescape extends its protection to the runtime environment, providing continuous monitoring and threat detection for deployed applications and runtime context to posture management.
- **IDE and CI/CD integration**: The tool integrates seamlessly with popular IDEs like VSCode and Lens, as well as CI/CD platforms such as GitHub and GitLab, allowing for security checks throughout the development process.
- **Cluster scanning**: Kubescape can scan active Kubernetes clusters for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security issues.
- **Multi-framework compliance support**: Kubescape can test against many security frameworks, including NSA-CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guidance, MITRE ATT&CK , SOC 2, CIS Benchmarks and more. Thus, simplifying compliance efforts and protetcing from configuration drift.
- **YAML and Helm chart validation**: The tool checks YAML files and Helm charts for correct configuration according to the frameworks above, without requiring an active cluster.
- **Kubernetes hardening**: Kubescape ensures proactive identification and rapid remediation of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities through manual, recurring, or event-triggered scans.
- **Multi-cloud support**: Kubescape offers frictionless security across various cloud providers and Kubernetes distributions.
