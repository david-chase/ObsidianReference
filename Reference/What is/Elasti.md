Elasti is a Kubernetes-native controller that gives your **existing HTTP services** true **scale-to-zero**, without requiring major rewrites or platform buy-in.  Elasti ensures reliability by acting as a proxy that queues incoming requests for scaled-down services. Once these services are reactivated, Elasti processes the queued requests, so that no request is lost. This combination of cost savings and dependable performance makes Elasti an invaluable tool for efficient Kubernetes service management.
