**Gardener** is an **open-source Kubernetes management platform** developed by **SAP**. It provides **"Kubernetes as a Service" (KaaS)** by automating the deployment, operation, and lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters across **multiple infrastructures** â€” including public clouds, private data centers, and edge environments.

Unlike Rancher, which manages existing Kubernetes clusters, **Gardener automates the creation and management of entire Kubernetes clusters using Kubernetes itself**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Gardener?

- A **meta-Kubernetes system**: it uses Kubernetes to manage Kubernetes clusters.
    
- Deploys **"shoot clusters"** (user clusters) by leveraging a central **"seed cluster"**.
    
- Provides consistent Kubernetes cluster management across **multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments**.
    
- Focuses on **hyperscale, multi-tenant scenarios** (used by SAP to manage thousands of clusters).

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts in Gardener

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Garden Cluster**|The "management" cluster hosting Gardener itself (control plane of the system).|
|**Seed Cluster**|Kubernetes clusters used to host the control planes of multiple user clusters (shoots).|
|**Shoot Cluster**|The actual Kubernetes clusters used by end-users/applications (like GKE, EKS, but self-managed).|
|**Controller Manager**|Reconciles the desired state of shoot clusters, automating their lifecycle.|
