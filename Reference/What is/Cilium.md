**Cilium** is an open-source networking, observability, and security project for Kubernetes environments. It uses **eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** technology in the Linux kernel to provide high-performance networking and security between container workloads.

It's widely adopted for cloud-native networking because it offers modern alternatives to traditional kube-proxy and iptables-based solutions.

## ðŸ›  **What Does Cilium Do?**

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Container Networking (CNI)**|Provides scalable and efficient Kubernetes networking, replacing kube-proxy with eBPF-based load balancing.|
|**Network Security**|Enables identity-based security policies that work across clusters, cloud environments, and hybrid setups.|
|**Observability**|Offers deep visibility into network flows, service maps, DNS queries, and security events.|
|**Load Balancing**|Replaces kube-proxy using eBPF for faster, more scalable service load balancing.|
|**Multi-Cluster Networking**|Connects multiple Kubernetes clusters seamlessly.|
|**Service Mesh Mode (without Sidecars)**|Provides service mesh features (mTLS, L7 policy) without sidecars, reducing overhead.|

## ðŸ”§ **Key Technologies Used**

- **eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)**: Allows safe, dynamic insertion of programs into the Linux kernel for networking, tracing, security, etc.
    
- **XDP (eXpress Data Path)**: Ultra-fast packet processing.
    
- **Envoy Integration**: For L7 observability and policy enforcement (e.g., HTTP metrics, API-aware policies).

## ðŸš€ **Why Use Cilium?**

- **Performance**: eBPF drastically reduces overhead compared to iptables-based CNIs.
    
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale Kubernetes clusters more efficiently.
    
- **Security**: Fine-grained network policies with identity-aware enforcement.
    
- **Observability**: Rich telemetry for debugging and monitoring network flows.
    
- **Simplified Service Mesh**: Native service mesh capabilities without sidecars.
    
- **Cloud Agnostic**: Works across any Kubernetes cluster (bare metal, on-prem, cloud).
