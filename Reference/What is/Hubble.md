**Cilium Hubble** is a **fully distributed observability platform** for **Kubernetes networking and security**, built on top of **Cilium**.

Hubble provides **deep visibility into network traffic, service-to-service communication, security policies, DNS queries, and flow logs** inside a Kubernetes cluster. It gives you **real-time observability** of how microservices are interacting â€” critical for debugging, performance monitoring, and security auditing.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Cilium?

Before Hubble:

- **Cilium** is an open-source **CNI (Container Network Interface)** plugin for Kubernetes.
    
- Built on **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** technology.
    
- Provides **high-performance networking, security policies, and load balancing**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Hubble?

- An **observability layer for Cilium-powered Kubernetes clusters**.
    
- Provides **real-time visibility into network flows and API interactions**.
    
- Offers **L3 (network), L4 (transport), and L7 (application) visibility**.
    
- Designed to monitor **east-west traffic** (internal service-to-service traffic) and **north-south traffic** (external ingress/egress).
