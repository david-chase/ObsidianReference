**MongoDB** is a popular open-source **NoSQL database** designed for storing and managing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases (like MySQL), MongoDB uses a **document-oriented** model to store data in flexible, JSON-like **BSON** (Binary JSON) documents.

It's widely used for modern web applications, big data, real-time analytics, and cloud-native development.

## üóÑÔ∏è **Key Features of MongoDB**

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Document-Oriented Storage**     | Data is stored in flexible documents (BSON), not rigid tables, allowing for schema-less designs. |
| **Scalability**                   | Supports horizontal scaling through sharding, making it suitable for handling large datasets.    |
| **High Availability**             | Replica sets ensure data redundancy and automatic failover for reliability.                      |
| **Powerful Query Language**       | Supports rich queries, aggregation pipelines, indexing, and text search.                         |
| **Horizontal Scaling (Sharding)** | Automatically partitions data across multiple nodes for distributed systems.                     |
| **Integrated Data Types**         | Supports arrays, embedded documents, geospatial data, and more.                                  |
| **Cloud-Native**                  | MongoDB Atlas offers fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) on AWS, Azure, and GCP.         |
