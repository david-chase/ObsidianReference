**Podman** is an **open-source container engine** that allows you to **build, run, manage, and share containers and container images**. Itâ€™s often considered a **drop-in replacement for Docker**, but with some architectural differences that make it appealing for certain use cases, especially in **enterprise and security-sensitive environments**.

Developed by **Red Hat**, Podman is widely used in **Linux distributions** and **cloud-native environments**.
