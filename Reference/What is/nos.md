`nos`Â is an open-source module to efficiently run AI workloads on Kubernetes, increasing GPU utilization, cutting down infrastructure costs and improving workloads performance.

Currently, the available features are:

- [Dynamic GPU partitioning](https://nebuly-ai.github.io/nos/dynamic-gpu-partitioning/overview): allow to schedule Pods requesting fractions of GPU. GPU partitioning is performed automatically in real-time based on the Pods pending and running in the cluster, so that Pods can request only the resources that are strictly necessary and GPUs are always fully utilized.
    
- [Elastic Resource Quota management](https://nebuly-ai.github.io/nos/elastic-resource-quota/overview): increase the number of Pods running on the cluster by allowing namespaces to borrow quotas of reserved resources from other namespaces as long as they are not using them.
