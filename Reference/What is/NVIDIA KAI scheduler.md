**NVIDIA KAI Scheduler** is an **open-source, Kubernetes-native scheduler** designed specifically to optimize **GPU resource allocation** for AI and machine learning (ML) workloads. Originally developed within the Run:ai platform, it‚Äôs now available under the Apache¬†2.0 license, enabling community adoption and collaboration.

## üîë **Key Features**

- **Fractional GPU sharing**  
    Unlike vanilla Kubernetes, which only allows whole GPU allocations, KAI supports fractional allocation (e.g., 0.5, 0.3 GPUs) for more granular and efficient resource use.
- **Gang scheduling & batch execution**  
    Ensures related pods (e.g., a distributed training job) are scheduled together or not at all, streamlining multi-pod workloads.
- **Queue and priority support**  
    Offers hierarchical queues with priority, quotas, and Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) to balance resource access among teams and workloads.
- **Dynamic resource adjustment & reclamation**  
    Automatically adjusts allocations to reduce fragmentation and reclaims unused resources for better overall utilization.
- **Runs alongside default scheduler**  
    Deployable in a Kubernetes cluster without replacing core components‚Äîcoexists with default schedulers for broader flexibility.

## üìà **Why It Matters**

- **Boosts GPU utilization** ‚Äî Tackles inefficiencies in large-scale AI clusters, such as idle GPU memory in inference or test tasks.
- **Reduces job wait times** ‚Äî Intelligent queuing and resource fairness minimize delays for interactive data science and training jobs.
- **Optimized for AI workloads** ‚Äî Supports the full AI lifecycle, from lightweight iteration to large training/inference jobs.
