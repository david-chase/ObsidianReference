Apache SparkÂ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

#### Batch/streaming data

Unify the processing of your data in batches and real-time streaming, using your preferred language: Python, SQL, Scala, Java or R.

#### SQL analytics

Execute fast, distributed ANSI SQL queries for dashboarding and ad-hoc reporting. Runs faster than most data warehouses.

#### Data science at scale

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on petabyte-scale data without having to resort to downsampling

#### Machine learning

Train machine learning algorithms on a laptop and use the same code to scale to fault-tolerant clusters of thousands of machines
