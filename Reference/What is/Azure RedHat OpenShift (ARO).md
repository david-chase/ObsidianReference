Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) is a fully managed OpenShift service jointly operated by Microsoft and Red Hat, running natively on Microsoft Azure. It provides Red Hat OpenShift clusters with deep Azure integration, while offloading cluster lifecycle management (installation, upgrades, control plane operations, and core infrastructure) to the platform.

ARO is designed for enterprises that want the full OpenShift experience—including Red Hat’s Kubernetes extensions and enterprise support—without operating the underlying cluster infrastructure themselves.

This service is distinct from “OpenShift on Azure” (self-managed) in that Microsoft and Red Hat jointly manage the control plane and core services.

## Core characteristics

- Based on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Runs on Azure-native infrastructure (VMs, VNets, Azure Load Balancer)
- Jointly supported and operated by Microsoft and Red Hat
- SLA-backed availability and support
- Customer manages workloads; platform manages the cluster
