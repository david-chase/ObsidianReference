**Crossplane** is an open-source Kubernetes add-on that enables **infrastructure as code (IaC)** and **infrastructure as data** by using Kubernetes resources to manage infrastructure. It allows you to provision and manage cloud resources (like databases, storage, VPCs, Kubernetes clusters, etc.) using Kubernetes-native APIs.

Think of Crossplane as **"Kubernetes meets Terraform"** â€” but with some unique advantages.

## ðŸ›  **What Does Crossplane Do?**

- Manages infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba, etc.) using Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).
    
- Enables **GitOps-style** workflows for infrastructure (just like apps).
    
- Provides **composability**: you can define higher-level abstractions (like "production database") as Kubernetes resources.
    
- Supports **multi-cloud** and **hybrid cloud** strategies.
    
- Can replace Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, or work alongside them.
