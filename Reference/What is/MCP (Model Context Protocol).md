In AI development, **MCP** stands for **Model Context Protocol**. Introduced by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP is an open standard designed to connect AI assistantsâ€”such as large language models (LLMs)â€”to external tools, data sources, and services in a secure and standardized manner. It addresses the challenge of integrating AI models with diverse tools, databases, and content repositories by providing a universal method for such connections. â€‹[Humanloop+23Fierce Network+23Wikipedia+23](https://www.fierce-network.com/cloud/what-mcp-and-why-does-it-matter-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[arXiv+9Wikipedia+9Victor Dibia+9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Descope+3Humanloop+3Wikipedia+3](https://humanloop.com/blog/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### ðŸ”§ What Is MCP?

MCP enables AI systems to interact with various data sources and tools through a standardized protocol. This allows AI assistants to perform tasks like reading files, querying databases, or interacting with APIs without the need for custom integrations for each data source. By doing so, MCP simplifies the development process and enhances the capabilities of AI applications.
