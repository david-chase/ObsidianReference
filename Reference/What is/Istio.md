**Istio** is an **open-source service mesh platform** that provides a way to **secure, connect, observe, and control microservices traffic** in a Kubernetes environment (and beyond).

It adds **advanced networking, security, and observability features** without requiring changes to application code â€” by managing how services communicate with each other.

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Service Mesh?

A **service mesh** is a dedicated infrastructure layer that manages **service-to-service communication** in a microservices architecture.  
It handles things like:

- Traffic routing
    
- Security (TLS encryption, authentication, authorization)
    
- Observability (metrics, logging, tracing)
    
- Resilience (circuit breaking, retries, timeouts)

## ðŸ”¹ What is Istio?

- A **service mesh implementation**.
    
- Manages microservices communication **transparently**.
    
- Primarily used with **Kubernetes**, but can extend to VMs.
    
- Based on **sidecar proxies** (Envoy) injected alongside application pods.
