**CRI-O** is an **open-source container runtime specifically designed for Kubernetes**. It implements the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**, which is the API Kubernetes uses to communicate with container runtimes.

Unlike general-purpose runtimes like Docker or containerd (which can be used outside of Kubernetes), **CRI-O is purpose-built solely to run containers in Kubernetes environments**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points about CRI-O:

### 1. **Kubernetes Native**:

- Designed to be a minimal, stable, and Kubernetes-focused runtime.
    
- Strictly adheres to the CRI specification.
    
- No extra features like Docker's CLI, image build system, or swarm mode.
    

### 2. **Lightweight & Secure**:

- Smaller codebase than Docker.
    
- Focused on **security features** (e.g., SELinux, seccomp, AppArmor, rootless containers).
    
- Supports **Kata Containers** and **gVisor** for sandboxed container workloads.
    

### 3. **OCI-Compliant**:

- Uses the **Open Container Initiative (OCI)** standards for container images and runtime (uses **runc** by default).
    
- Can plug in other OCI-compatible runtimes for sandboxing (e.g., Kata, runsc).
    

### 4. **Image Management**:

- Can pull images from container registries.
    
- Handles storage and networking through external components (like CNI for networking and overlayfs for storage).
    

### 5. **Used by OpenShift**:

- **Red Hat OpenShift** (a popular Kubernetes distribution) uses CRI-O as its default container runtime.
    
- Well-integrated with Red Hat's enterprise-grade security and SELinux policies.
