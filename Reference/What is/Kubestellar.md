Kubestellar is an **open-source Kubernetes-native project** designed for **multi-cluster and edge application management**. It enables you to manage applications across **tens, hundreds, or even thousands of Kubernetes clusters** in a way that is consistent, GitOps-friendly, and resource-efficient. Unlike traditional multi-cluster solutions that centralize control, Kubestellar focuses on **decentralized edge and IoT use cases**, where clusters may be small, intermittently connected, or resource-constrained.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Points

- **Purpose**
    - Simplifies running apps across **many edge clusters**.
    - Provides **GitOps-style declarative management** for distributed Kubernetes environments.
    - Optimized for clusters that may be **lightweight** and **occasionally offline**.
- **Architecture**
    - Uses a **central control cluster** (the "home cluster") to define workloads and policies.
    - Distributes these workloads to **edge clusters** (called "spokes") for execution.
    - Leverages Kubernetes-native APIs and custom controllers.
- **Core Features**
    - **Multi-cluster application placement**: Deploy workloads once, run them in many clusters.
    - **Workload synchronization**: Keeps workloads in sync across spoke clusters.
    - **Disconnected operation**: Edge clusters can run apps even when not connected to the control plane.
    - **Policy-driven management**: Placement and updates are controlled by declarative policies.
- **Use Cases**
    - Retail (apps running across thousands of stores).
    - Telecom (managing workloads across 5G edge sites).
    - IoT (factories, transport hubs, and remote locations).
- **Community & Ecosystem**
    - CNCF Sandbox project (early-stage, but active community).
    - Complements GitOps tools like ArgoCD and Flux.
    - Works alongside lightweight Kubernetes distributions like K3s, MicroK8s, and EKS Anywhere.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **Kubestellar is Kubernetes for the Edge, at scale**â€”helping you manage thousands of small clusters as easily as one.
