#### Blazinâ€™ fast PromQL

Cortex makes your PromQL queries blazin' fast through aggressive parallelization and caching.

#### A global view of data

Cortex gives you a global view of Prometheus time series data that includes data in long-term storage, greatly expanding the usefulness of PromQL for analytical purposes.

#### Horizontally scalable

Cortex runs across multiple machines in a cluster, exceeding the throughput and storage of a single machine. This enables you to send the metrics from multiple Prometheus servers to a single Cortex cluster.
