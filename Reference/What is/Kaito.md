Kaito is an open-source Kubernetes operator designed to automate AI/ML model inference and tuning workflows within a Kubernetes cluster. It streamlines the deployment of large open‑source models—like Falcon or Phi—by managing model container images, auto-provisioning GPU nodes, and orchestrating inference runtimes (e.g., vLLM, Transformers) 

**Key Features:**

- **Automated GPU provisioning** based on model requirements
    
- **OpenAI-compatible inference API server**
    
- **Preset configurations** tuned per GPU hardware
    
- **Support for popular runtimes** like vLLM and Transformers
    
- **Hosted model images** in Microsoft Container Registry (where licensing permits)
