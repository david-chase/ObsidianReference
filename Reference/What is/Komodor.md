**Komodor** is a Kubernetes-native **incident management and troubleshooting platform** designed to give DevOps, SRE, and platform teams a real-time view of changes and issues in their Kubernetes clusters. It focuses on **visualizing changes**, correlating them with incidents, and accelerating root cause analysis to reduce Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).

Komodor aims to provide a **"Kubernetes change intelligence"** layerâ€”surfacing operational insights, deployment events, health anomalies, and service dependencies across clusters.
