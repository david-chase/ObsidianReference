Gatekeeper is a validating and mutating webhook that enforces CRD-based policies executed by Open Policy Agent, a policy engine for Cloud Native environments hosted by CNCF as a graduated project.

In addition to the admission scenario, Gatekeeper's audit functionality allows administrators to see what resources are currently violating any given policy.

Finally, Gatekeeper's engine is designed to be portable, allowing administrators to detect and reject non-compliant commits to an infrastructure-as-code system's source-of-truth, further strengthening compliance efforts and preventing bad state from slowing down the organization.
