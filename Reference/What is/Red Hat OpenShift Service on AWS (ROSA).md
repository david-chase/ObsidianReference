**Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)** is a fully managed OpenShift offering jointly operated by Red Hat and Amazon Web Services. It delivers **managed OpenShift clusters running natively on AWS infrastructure**, with Red Hat and AWS sharing responsibility for cluster lifecycle, availability, and support. From a user perspective, it is the AWS-native way to consume enterprise OpenShift without operating the control plane yourself.

At a high level, ROSA = **OpenShift + AWS primitives + managed SRE operations**.
