Grafana Alloy is Grafana Labs’ distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector. It is an OTLP-compatible collector with built-in Prometheus optimizations that also supports signals across metrics, logs, traces, and profiles.

Alloy was started at Grafana Labs and announced at GrafanaCON in 2024. The mission for the project is to create the best “big tent” collector that’s compatible with the most popular open source observability ecosystems and includes enterprise-grade features to simplify operating at scale in a modern cloud native infrastructure.
