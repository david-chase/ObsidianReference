**MariaDB** is a popular open-source **relational database management system (RDBMS)** that is a **drop-in replacement for MySQL**. It was created by the original developers of MySQL after Oracle acquired MySQL, to ensure it remained free and open-source.

MariaDB retains full compatibility with MySQL in terms of commands, connectors, and tools, but has since developed its own features and performance enhancements.
