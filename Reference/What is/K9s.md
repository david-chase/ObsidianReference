**K9s** is a terminal-based UI tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It provides a fast, interactive, and keyboard-driven interface to manage and monitor Kubernetes resources.

### 🐶 What K9s Does:

- Provides a real-time terminal dashboard for Kubernetes.
- Allows you to **view, edit, delete, and manage** resources (pods, deployments, services, etc.).
- Supports **log streaming**, **exec into pods**, and **resource filtering**.
- Automatically refreshes data for dynamic insight into cluster state.

### 🔧 Key Features:

- **Keyboard shortcuts** for fast navigation.
- **Resource drill-downs** (e.g., see pod logs, container metrics).
- **Custom plugins** and skinning via configuration files.
- **Context/namespace switching** without needing to leave the tool.
- Integrated **port forwarding** and **exec sessions**.

### 🧑‍💻 Why It's Useful:

- Great for **DevOps and SREs** who prefer CLI tools.
- Faster than typing repeated `kubectl` commands.
- Helps debug and monitor clusters without needing a GUI (like Lens or Rancher).
