**Zig** is a **modern, low-level programming language** designed for **performance, safety, and simplicity**, often seen as an alternative to C for systems programming.

It aims to provide the power and control of C, but with **better safety features, cross-compilation support, and modern tooling**. Zig is often used for **operating systems, game engines, compilers, and performance-critical applications**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Zig?

- A **programming language for system-level development**.
    
- Focuses on:
    
    - **Predictable performance**.
        
    - **Safety without a garbage collector**.
        
    - **Simplicity and readability**.
        
- Designed to be a **better C**, not a C++ replacement.
    
- Provides **direct control over memory, no hidden control flow, and zero-cost abstractions**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Zig

| Feature                               | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual Memory Management**          | Full control, like C, but safer with optional runtime checks.                      |
| **No Hidden Control Flow**            | No implicit memory allocation, exceptions, or multithreading.                      |
| **Cross-Compilation Built-in**        | Zig can cross-compile to other targets easily, replacing complex build toolchains. |
| **Interop with C**                    | Seamlessly call C code and compile C libraries with Zig.                           |
| **Comptime (Compile-Time Execution)** | Powerful metaprogramming abilities via compile-time code execution.                |
| **Error Handling Model**              | No exceptions; uses explicit error unions and propagation.                         |
| **LLVM & Self-Hosted Backend**        | Uses LLVM for codegen, with a developing self-hosted compiler backend.             |
| **Minimal Standard Library**          | Lightweight, focused on essential system facilities.                               |
