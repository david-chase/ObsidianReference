The Kyverno project provides a comprehensive set of tools to manage the complete Policy-as-Code (PaC) lifecycle for Kubernetes and other cloud native environments

Kyverno policies are declarative YAML resources and no new language is required. Kyverno enables use of familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno supports JMESPath and the Common Expressions Language (CEL) for efficient handling of complex logic.

In Kubernetes environments, Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, generate, and cleanup any Kubernetes resource, including custom resources. To help secure the software supply chain Kyverno policies can verify OCI container image signatures and artifacts. Kyverno policy reports and policy exceptions are also Kubernetes API resources.
