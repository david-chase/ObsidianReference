**Exostellar SDG** (Software-Defined Grid) is a cloud resource optimization and orchestration platform developed by [Exostellar, Inc.](https://www.exostellar.com) (formerly Exotanium). SDG focuses on real-time, dynamic cloud workload management to improve efficiency and reduce cost, particularly for containerized and batch-based applications. It leverages live migration, predictive analytics, and proprietary sandboxing technologies to move running workloads across different cloud instances or availability zones without disruption.

### üîë **Key Features**

- **Live Cloud Workload Migration**  
    Seamlessly moves workloads (e.g., Docker containers) between cloud VM types or availability zones without downtime.
    
- **Cost Optimization**  
    Continuously identifies cheaper or more efficient resources (e.g., spot vs on-demand instances) and migrates workloads accordingly.
    
- **Proprietary Smart Sandboxing**  
    Uses secure containers that isolate applications from the underlying OS and infrastructure to facilitate migration and security.
    
- **Policy-Based Orchestration**  
    Allows users to define constraints (e.g., performance, cost, SLAs), which SDG uses to automate placement decisions.
    
- **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Support**  
    Works across major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and supports hybrid environments, enabling more flexible resource management.
    
- **AI-Powered Resource Scheduling**  
    Predictive models optimize resource use and forecast demand to ensure efficient scheduling.
