**Kubetail** is an open-source tool for Kubernetes that provides a **real-time log streaming and dashboard experience**, combining both a CLI and a web interface. Here's a breakdown of what it is and where to find it:

---

## 🚀 What is Kubetail?

- **Real-time Kubernetes logging**: Aggregates logs from multiple pods/containers and streams them in real-time, either to your terminal or the web dashboard 
    
- **Dual interface**:
    
    - **CLI (`kubetail`)**: Tail logs directly in the terminal.
        
    - **Web dashboard**: Visual interface accessible via `kubetail serve`, letting you explore logs across workloads, filter by timestamp, grep content, and more 
        
- **Features**:
    
    - Filter by workload, node properties, and time.
        
    - Uses the Kubernetes API—no need for external log forwarding, keeping data secure and local
