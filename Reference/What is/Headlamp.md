## üî¶ What Is Headlamp?

**Headlamp** is an open-source, user-friendly Kubernetes UI built for both **web and desktop environments**. It supports managing multiple clusters, comes with RBAC-aware controls, and emphasizes extensibility through plugins.

- **Web & Desktop Support**  
    Run it in-cluster via Helm or Docker, or as a native desktop app on Linux, macOS, or Windows 
    
- **RBAC-Aware**  
    The UI dynamically adapts to your Kubernetes permissions‚Äîif you're not allowed to delete a resource, the UI won't let you 
    
- **Extensibility via Plugins**  
    Designed with a plugin system so vendors or teams can add custom features without forking the core project. For example, there‚Äôs an official Flux plugin for GitOps workflows
