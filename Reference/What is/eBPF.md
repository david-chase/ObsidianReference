**eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** is a powerful technology that enables the execution of sandboxed programs within the operating system kernel, allowing developers to extend kernel capabilities without modifying the kernel source code or loading kernel modules. â€‹[Wikipedia+16ebpf.foundation+16ebpf.io+16](https://ebpf.foundation/home/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### ðŸ”¹ What is eBPF?

eBPF is a revolutionary technology originating from the Linux kernel that allows for the safe and efficient extension of kernel functionalities. It operates by running sandboxed programs in a privileged context, such as the operating system kernel, without the need to alter the kernel's source code or load additional modules. â€‹[ebpf.foundation+1ebpf.io+1](https://ebpf.foundation/home/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[ebpf.io](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features

- **Safety**: eBPF programs are verified before execution to ensure they do not compromise kernel stability.
    
- **Performance**: By running in the kernel space, eBPF programs can operate with high efficiency.
    
- **Flexibility**: Developers can write custom programs for various purposes, including networking, security, and observability.
