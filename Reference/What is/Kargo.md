**Kargo** is an open-source continuous delivery (CD) tool for Kubernetes, created by [Akuity](https://akuity.io) (the company behind Argo CD). It manages progressive promotion of container images and Helm/Kustomize deployments **across environments**, such as dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod, based on approval gates or automated checks.

Kargo excels at **environment promotion workflows**, solving a common gap in GitOps by introducing multi-environment awareness and safe, automated progression between them.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

- Written in **Go**
- Runs as a **Kubernetes controller**
- Uses **CRDs** to define environments and promotion workflows
- **RBAC**-aware and namespace-scoped by design

### üì¶ Typical Use Case

A user deploys an image to `dev` and wants it to move to `staging` only if:

- Tests pass
- SLOs are met
- A manual approval is given

Kargo automates and tracks this promotion, avoiding manual re-tagging or copy/paste of values between environment overlays.

### üîß Components

- **Freight**: A deployable version of a workload (e.g., container image + Helm values)
- **Warehouse**: A staging area that holds valid Freights
- **Environment**: A GitOps-managed target environment
- **PromotionPolicy**: Defines how promotions happen between environments
