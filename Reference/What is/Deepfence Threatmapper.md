ThreatMapper is an open-source, cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP). Scan for vulnerabilities, malware, compliance misconfigurations, exposed secrets and prioritize these critical cloud security alerts by exploitability. ThreatMapper works across all clouds and workload types, VMs, containers, Kubernetes, serverless, and more.

### üìå What Is ThreatMapper?

- **Open-Source CNAPP** ‚Äî ThreatMapper is a free, open-source platform used to scan, map, and rank security threats across your cloud-native environments [deepfence.io](https://www.deepfence.io/threatmapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[deepfence.io](https://www.deepfence.io/blog/threatmapper-is-now-100-open-source?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- It combines agent-based sensors (eBPF) and agentless scans to detect vulnerabilities, malware, secrets, compliance issues, and misconfigurations [community.deepfence.io](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### üîç Key Capabilities

1. **Discovery & Mapping**
    
    - Autonomously identifies hosts, containers, pods, serverless components, and cloud assets
        
    - Builds a dynamic topology graph of your infrastructure [community.deepfence.io](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[deepfence.io](https://www.deepfence.io/threatmapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
2. **Threat Detection**
    
    - Generates SBOMs and matches them to CVEs and other threat feeds
        
    - Scans for exposed secrets and compliance violations (CIS, PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) [community.deepfence.io](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[TheSecMaster](https://thesecmaster.com/tools/deepfence-threatmapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
3. **Attack Path Analysis**
    
    - Constructs a **ThreatGraph**, correlating vulnerabilities with network telemetry
        
    - Ranks threats based on exploitability and proximity to attack surfaces [community.deepfence.io](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[deepfence.io](https://www.deepfence.io/blog/scaling-threatmapper-detecting-threats-on-100k-servers-and-beyond?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[TheSecMaster](https://thesecmaster.com/tools/deepfence-threatmapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
4. **Runtime Observability**
    
    - Monitors live workloads to detect which vulnerabilities are actively exploitable, reducing noise and false positives [TheSecMaster](https://thesecmaster.com/tools/deepfence-threatmapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
5. **Compliance & SBOM**
    
    - Compliance checks across various standards
        
    - Auto-generates SBOMs for containers, hosts, and functions [deepfence.io](https://www.deepfence.io/threatmapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[TheSecMaster](https://thesecmaster.com/tools/deepfence-threatmapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### üõ† Architecture & Deployment

- **Management Console** ‚Äì runs centrally (via Docker or Kubernetes) to aggregate data [GitHub](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Sensors & Cloud Scanner Tasks**
    
    - **Sensor agents** deployed as eBPF daemons or sidecars to observe hosts, containers, serverless workloads [community.deepfence.io](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    - **Cloud Scanners** integrate via API (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP) for infrastructure posture scanning [community.deepfence.io](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        

Deepfence even demonstrates ThreatMapper running across massive scales‚Äîup to 100k servers and tens of thousands of Kubernetes nodes‚Äîby leveraging efficient design and architecture [deepfence.io](https://www.deepfence.io/blog/scaling-threatmapper-detecting-threats-on-100k-servers-and-beyond?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
