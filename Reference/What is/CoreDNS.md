## ðŸ”¹ CoreDNS in Kubernetes

In a Kubernetes cluster:

- When a **pod needs to resolve a service name** (e.g., `my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`), the request is handled by **CoreDNS**.
    
- CoreDNS runs as a **Deployment in the kube-system namespace**.
    
- It listens on a **ClusterIP service (typically 10.96.0.10)**.
    
- Kubernetes nodes configure pods to use this IP as their DNS resolver.
