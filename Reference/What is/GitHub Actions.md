**GitHub Actions** is an **automation and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform** built into **GitHub**. It allows you to automate **workflows** for building, testing, deploying, and managing software projects directly from your GitHub repository.

With GitHub Actions, you can define workflows using **YAML files** that run in response to **events** like code pushes, pull requests, issue comments, or scheduled cron jobs.
