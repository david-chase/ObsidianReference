**Kube-OVN** is a **Kubernetes network plugin** based on [Open vSwitch (OVS)](https://www.openvswitch.org/) and [OVN (Open Virtual Network)](https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn), designed to provide **flexible, scalable, and high-performance networking** for Kubernetes clusters. It combines native Kubernetes experience with powerful features from the SDN (Software Defined Networking) world, such as VLAN, subnet isolation, QoS, IP management, and more.

- **Built-in Subnet Management:**
    - Custom subnet configuration
    - IP and MAC address management
- **Policy and Security:**
    - Network Policies compatible with Kubernetes
    - ACLs and Security Groups for fine-grained control
- **QoS and Traffic Control:** Per-pod ingress/egress rate limiting
- **Gateway Support:**
    - Centralized or distributed gateway modes
    - North-South traffic handling
- **BGP and Egress Gateway:** Native BGP support and SNAT capabilities
