**Pulumi** is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform** that allows you to **define, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure** using **general-purpose programming languages** like **TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, Java, and YAML**.

Unlike traditional IaC tools like Terraform, which use domain-specific languages (HCL), **Pulumi leverages real programming languages**, giving developers access to loops, conditionals, functions, and libraries when defining infrastructure.
