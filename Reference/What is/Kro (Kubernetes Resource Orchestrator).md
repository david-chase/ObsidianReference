**Kro** (short for _Kube Resource Orchestrator_) is an open-source, Kubernetes-native tool designed to simplify the management of complex, multi-resource applications. Developed collaboratively by AWS, Google, and Microsoft, Kro enables platform teams to define reusable APIs that bundle multiple Kubernetes resources into a single, manageable unit, streamlining deployment and reducing operational complexity. â€‹

### ðŸ”§ What Kro Does

At its core, Kro introduces the concept of a **ResourceGraphDefinition (RGD)**. An RGD allows you to declaratively define a set of Kubernetes resourcesâ€”such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and even cloud-managed resources like databases or storage bucketsâ€”and specify their relationships and dependencies. Kro then automatically generates the necessary Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and controllers to manage these resources as a cohesive unit. â€‹
