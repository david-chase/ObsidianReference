Observability platform built for simplicity. Say goodbye to manual analysis of metrics,  
logs, and traces. Gain actionable insights and focus on remediation.
## Zero-instrumentation

Coroot uses eBPF to automatically collect comprehensive telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces. It provides a detailed Service Map of the entire system, eliminating blind spots. Coroot also includes predefined inspections that can identify root causes for over 80% of issues without requiring any configuration.

## Application Health Summary

Coroot’s Application Health Summary feature makes it easy to understand the status of your services, even when you have hundreds of them. It provides instant insights into application logs and tracks Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for efficient performance monitoring.

## Distributed Tracing

Coroot’s distributed tracing helps you answer critical questions about your system’s performance:

- Why are some requests failing?
- Why are certain requests taking longer than expected?

Coroot fully supports OpenTelemetry, ensuring no vendor lock-in. Struggling to instrument legacy or third-party services? Coroot’s eBPF-based instrumentation captures requests without any code changes.

## Log Monitoring

Grasp insights from logs with just a quick glance. Coroot performs low-overhead log analysis right on the node to identify message severities and recurring patterns. This process is seamless and compatible with a wide range of log formats, providing valuable meta-information for quick and easy log analysis.
