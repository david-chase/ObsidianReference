**MetalLB** is an **open-source load-balancer implementation for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters**. It provides **LoadBalancer-type services** functionality, which is typically only available in cloud environments (like AWS ELB, GCP LB, Azure LB), but for **on-premises and bare-metal setups**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why MetalLB?

- In **cloud Kubernetes**, `ServiceType: LoadBalancer` automatically provisions a cloud load balancer.
    
- On **bare-metal clusters**, thereâ€™s no native load balancer API.
    
- MetalLB fills this gap by providing a **software load balancer** that integrates with Kubernetes.
