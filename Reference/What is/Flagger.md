**Flagger** is an **open-source progressive delivery tool for Kubernetes**. It automates **canary deployments, blue/green deployments, and A/B testing** for applications running in Kubernetes clusters.

Flagger works by continuously **monitoring metrics and health checks** of new versions of applications and gradually shifting traffic to them. If something goes wrong, it can **automatically rollback** to the previous version.

Itâ€™s commonly used with service meshes (like Istio, Linkerd, Kuma) or ingress controllers (NGINX, Contour, Traefik) to **control traffic routing during deployments**.
