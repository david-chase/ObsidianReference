**Ansible** is an open-source IT automation and configuration management tool developed by Red Hat. It allows you to automate tasks such as application deployment, configuration management, orchestration, and provisioning across your infrastructure. Ansible is known for being **agentless**, using **SSH (or WinRM for Windows)** to connect to managed systems, and for its **declarative YAML-based playbooks**.

### ðŸ”‘ **Key Features**

- **Agentless Architecture**  
    No software needs to be installed on the target machinesâ€”uses SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows).
    
- **YAML-Based Playbooks**  
    Uses simple, human-readable YAML syntax for defining automation tasks.
    
- **Idempotency**  
    Ensures tasks are only applied when neededâ€”running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result.
    
- **Inventory Management**  
    Tracks target hosts using static files, dynamic inventory scripts, or plugins (e.g., AWS, Azure, VMware).
    
- **Modules Library**  
    Comes with hundreds of built-in modules for managing files, packages, services, cloud resources, etc.
    
- **Extensibility**  
    Supports custom modules, plugins, roles, and collections to extend capabilities.
