Tekton is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premise systems.

#### Standardization

Tekton standardizes CI/CD tooling and processes across vendors, languages, and deployment environments. It works well with Jenkins, Jenkins X, Skaffold, Knative, and many other popular CI/CD tools.

#### Built-in best practices

Tekton lets you create CI/CD systems quickly, giving you scalable, serverless, cloud native execution out of the box.

#### Maximum flexibility

Tekton abstracts the underlying implementation so that you can choose the build, test, and deploy workflow based on your teamâ€™s requirements.
