Stop asking “Where do I find…?” and start building an Internal Developer Portal (IDP) to decrease the internal pain in every engineering organization.

## What is Backstage.io?

It’s an open-source platform created at Spotify and now a graduated project of the _Cloud Native Computing Foundation_ (_CNCF_). It’s not just another tool; it’s a platform for building the _one_ tool to rule them all (_yes, I’m a LOTR fan_) your own **Internal Developer Portal (IDP).**

Think of it as a single, centralized frontend application for your entire engineering ecosystem. It’s a **web application**, hosted by you, that unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, metrics, and documentation into one page.

## Why do we need IDP?

While developing a microservices application, **it’s hard to track owners**, **documentation**, **metrics**, etc. multiple teams owning multiple things and it creates too much internal chaos during the engineering phase. Even your **well-documented Confluence Pages or Readme files will be forgotten over time.**

The biggest pain is **onboarding a new employee**. They will have a lot of questions like;

_Which repository holds this service?  
Who owns this API?  
Where is the documentation for the checkout service?  
What’s the process for provisioning a new database?  
Which dashboard shows the production metrics for my team?  
Where is the link to our staging environment?_

And also there will be access/permissions issues for the applications (_Confluence for docs, Grafana for metrics, etc..)_

**With Backstage**, you can collect every necessary information on one page, with drawers.

## Is Backstage Right for You?

> _Backstage is a powerful solution, but it is not a “_set it and forget it_” tool._ **_It is an investment for long-term._**

**Backstage is likely a great fit if:**

- You’re a mid scale engineering organization (_~30 developers_)
- Developers complain about _Where / What / Who_ kinda questions.
- Onboarding new developers is a time consuming, painful process.
- You are managing / developing a complex microservices architecture.
- You have a platform team that can own and customize the portal.

**Backstage might be overkill if:**

- You are a small startup with a single team and a handful of services.
- You have no dedicated resources to maintain an internal platform.
- You don’t have complex architecture

It’s a long term commitment for b**ig enterprises to simplify the development process**. It will be overkill and time consuming service for small companies. It has own challenges.

## **How to install Backstage ?**

For installation, there are many ways to install it. Since it’s just an example doc we will follow the simplest one.

You can simultaneously follow this link: [Installing Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started)

After you complete the prerequisites on the link, you can run that command on your terminal

npx @backstage/create-app@latest

It will create and install the necessary components.

After the command completed, navigate the directory (medium-backstage for me) and run `yarn start`

It will start the Backstage with default configurations.

## Customize Backstage with Plugins

> Backstage is just an empty canvas. We need to customize it

With plugins we can expand the power of Backstage. What I’m using and personally recommending plugins are:

### ArgoCD Plugin

With this plugin I can track my deployment status without leaving the Backstage page and jump the ArgoCD UI with simple click if needed.

**Plugin Link:** [https://roadie.io/backstage/plugins/argo-cd](https://roadie.io/backstage/plugins/argo-cd/)

### Prometheus Plugin

See the critical metrics or alerts on the same page, without navigating the Grafana or Prometheus. It’s really useful for quick lookups.

## What is next?

With this article we learned the IDP solutions via Backstage and install the Backstage. In next articles I will guide:

- How to configure it for Kubernetes resources
- How to deploy an app from Backstage to Kubernetes
- GitHub Authentication
- Integrate with ArgoCD and Prometheus for GitOps & Monitoring
- Documentation, Service Flow, etc.
