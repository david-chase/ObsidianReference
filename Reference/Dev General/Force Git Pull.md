**Dave:** give me a git command to force my local repo to pull from the remote

**ChatGPT:**  
To force your local repository to pull from the remote and overwrite your local changes, you can use the following commands:

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/<branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of your branch, e.g., `main` or `master`.

### Explanation:
- `git fetch origin`: Updates your local copy of the remote branches.
- `git reset --hard origin/<branch-name>`: Resets your local branch to match the remote branch exactly, discarding any local changes.

⚠️ **Warning**: This command will delete any uncommitted local changes, so make sure you've committed or backed up anything important.
