You’ve nailed the essence: **“FSx” is not one product, but a family brand** AWS uses for its **managed, high-performance file system services**. Each FSx variant represents a **different underlying file system technology** — AWS just unifies them under the **“FSx” umbrella** for marketing and management consistency.

Let’s unpack what that really means:

---

## 🧱 **What “FSx” Actually Is**

Think of **Amazon FSx** as a **category name**, much like “EC2” (for compute instances) or “RDS” (for databases).  
Where **RDS** offers different database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.),  
**FSx** offers different **file system engines**, each fully managed and optimized for AWS.

So yes — **FSx is the “RDS for file systems.”**
