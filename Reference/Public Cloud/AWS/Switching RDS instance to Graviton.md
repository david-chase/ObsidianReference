Changing an AWS RDS instance from x86 (Intel/AMD) to **Graviton (ARM-based)** involves **moderate effort**‚Äînot huge, but not zero. The main steps and considerations include:

### ‚úÖ **Steps to Change RDS Architecture (x86 ‚Üí Graviton)**

1. ### **Check Compatibility**
    - **Engine Support**: Not all engines or versions support Graviton. Supported engines include:
        - **Amazon Aurora (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**
        - **RDS for MySQL**
        - **RDS for PostgreSQL**
        - **RDS for MariaDB**
        - **RDS for Oracle** and **SQL Server** do _not_ support Graviton.
    - **Check application compatibility with ARM64** if it uses native client libraries (e.g., compiled C code).
2. ### **Take a Snapshot**
    - Create a manual DB snapshot of the current x86 instance.
3. ### **Restore Snapshot to a Graviton Instance**
    - Use the snapshot to **launch a new instance** with a Graviton-based instance type (e.g., `db.m6g`, `db.r6g`, `db.t4g`).
    - There's **no in-place architecture conversion**. You need to restore into a new instance.
4. ### **Test the New Instance**
    - Validate performance, functionality, and application behavior.
    - Make sure any client software or drivers are **not dependent on x86 binary compatibility**.

5. ### **Switch Over**
    - Update DNS / endpoints.
    - Redirect traffic to the new Graviton instance.
    - Optionally delete the old x86 instance once confident in stability.

### üß† Things to Watch For

|Concern|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**In-place migration?**|Not supported. You need to **restore a snapshot to a Graviton instance**.|
|**Performance**|Graviton often provides **20‚Äì40% better price-performance**, but test your workload.|
|**Client binaries**|If your app uses native x86 client libraries, test them on ARM. Otherwise, this usually doesn't matter.|
|**Replication**|You can use **read replica promotion** to switch if needed.|
|**Downtime**|Expect a brief cutover period unless you're using replication or Aurora failover.|

### üîÅ Alternative: Blue-Green Deployment

You can minimize downtime by using [RDS Blue/Green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html) (if using Aurora) to handle the transition safely.
