# What is the difference between IRSA and EKS Pod Identity?

IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) and **EKS Pod Identity** are both mechanisms for assigning AWS IAM permissions to pods running in Amazon **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**. However, they differ in implementation, use cases, and security features.

## 1. IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)

- **How it works**:  
  - Uses **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** to associate Kubernetes **Service Accounts** with AWS IAM roles.
  - Requires setting up an **OIDC identity provider** in AWS IAM for your EKS cluster.
  - Pods assume the IAM role **via the service account** they are assigned to.
- **Benefits**:
  - Least privilege access with IAM policies per service account.
  - Uses AWS **IAM policy evaluation** mechanisms.
  - Secure and scalable for multi-tenant workloads.
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires an **OIDC provider** to be configured manually.
  - Can be complex to manage if many service accounts are needed.
  - Pods require restarting when role changes.

## 2. EKS Pod Identity *(Newer alternative, GA in 2024)*

- **How it works**:
  - Uses **Amazon Security Token Service (STS) and a webhook** to dynamically assign IAM roles to pods.
  - Pods request IAM credentials via a **pod identity daemon**.
  - IAM credentials are managed **outside the Kubernetes API**, reducing exposure.
- **Benefits**:
  - No need for manual OIDC setup.
  - More dynamic role assignment (roles can change without pod restarts).
  - Secure by default with **short-lived IAM credentials**.
- **Limitations**:
  - Newer feature, may not be as widely adopted yet.
  - Requires configuring **Pod Identity Associations** via AWS API.

## Key Differences

| Feature               | IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) | EKS Pod Identity |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| Authentication       | Uses **OIDC** with IAM roles           | Uses **STS tokens** |
| Role Association     | Tied to **Service Accounts**           | Dynamically assigned to pods |
| Setup Complexity     | Requires **OIDC provider setup**       | Easier, no OIDC needed |
| Credential Rotation  | **No automatic rotation** (unless pod restarted) | **Automatic rotation** |
| Best for             | Traditional IAM role assignment        | Dynamic IAM role management |

## Which One to Use?

- Use **IRSA** if:
  - Your workloads are already using IAM roles via **OIDC-based service accounts**.
  - You prefer the AWS **IAM policy-based approach** for access control.
  - You are running workloads that do **not require frequent role changes**.

- Use **EKS Pod Identity** if:
  - You want **simplified IAM integration** without managing an OIDC provider.
  - You need **automatic credential rotation** and **dynamic role assignment**.
  - Your applications require **frequent changes in IAM roles** without pod restarts.

## Final Thoughts

If you are starting fresh, **EKS Pod Identity** is generally the **better choice** due to its improved security, ease of setup, and flexibility. However, **IRSA** is still a reliable method and may be preferred in environments that already use OIDC-based authentication.
