### üß© Comparison of GPU Time Slicing Approaches

|**Method**|**Mechanism**|**Use Case**|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**NVIDIA GPU Time Slicing (Default Driver Scheduler)**|GPU driver schedules multiple CUDA contexts in round-robin fashion|Lightweight concurrent workloads, dev/test environments|‚úÖ Requires no special setup  <br>‚úÖ Available on most NVIDIA GPUs|‚ùå Weak isolation  <br>‚ùå Performance can vary under load|
|**NVIDIA `nvidia-time-slicing` Toolkit**|Container runtime plugin that enforces time slice boundaries (e.g., via cgroups and runtime class overrides)|Better-controlled containerized workloads in Kubernetes|‚úÖ Lets you define fixed time slices per container  <br>‚úÖ K8s integratable|‚ùå Still shares physical resources  <br>‚ùå Requires NVIDIA container toolkit|
|**Kubernetes Device Plugin Multi-Container Sharing**|GPU is shared across pods by modifying the device plugin behavior|Running multiple pods on the same GPU|‚úÖ Transparent to workloads  <br>‚úÖ Easy to prototype|‚ùå Needs custom device plugin  <br>‚ùå No resource guarantees|
|**vGPU (NVIDIA GRID or vGPU Manager)**|Software virtualization of GPU at the hypervisor level (e.g., VMware, Citrix)|Multi-tenant VMs or VDI environments with virtualized GPUs|‚úÖ Stronger user isolation  <br>‚úÖ Centralized control in VDI setups|‚ùå Commercial licensing required  <br>‚ùå Lower performance for AI workloads|
|**MPS (Multi-Process Service)**|Shares GPU context between multiple CUDA processes|Single user with many lightweight CUDA jobs|‚úÖ Reduced launch overhead  <br>‚úÖ Better GPU utilization|‚ùå Not container-aware  <br>‚ùå Limited K8s support|

### üîç Clarifying Notes

- **Default GPU driver scheduling** allows **basic time slicing** for processes sharing the same GPU, but lacks strict control or fairness.
    
- **`nvidia-time-slicing` toolkit** allows better control at the **container runtime level**‚Äîe.g., by defining a time slice duration like `100ms` per container.
    
- **K8s custom device plugin** sharing lets you **over-provision** GPUs artificially, but **requires engineering effort** to build a compliant scheduler.
    
- **vGPU** solutions are ideal in **VDI or virtualization platforms** but not designed for raw AI workloads.
    
- **MPS** is excellent for **same-user** multithreaded GPU use cases but is **not aware of Kubernetes boundaries**.

### üß† Summary Recommendation:

|**Use this if...**|**Best Method**|
|---|---|
|You're in Kubernetes and want soft GPU sharing|`nvidia-time-slicing` toolkit|
|You're doing HPC-style CUDA job multiplexing|NVIDIA MPS|
|You're running multi-user virtual desktops|NVIDIA vGPU / GRID|
|You want strong isolation and performance|Use MIG instead of time slicing|
