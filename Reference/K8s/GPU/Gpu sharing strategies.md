Sure, Dave ‚Äî here's a structured breakdown of the major GPU sharing strategies in Kubernetes clusters, including **how they work**, **main categories**, and **key vendor/tool support**.

## üîó GPU Sharing Strategies in Kubernetes

GPU sharing in Kubernetes allows **multiple containers or pods to share a single GPU** for better utilization. There are three primary strategies:

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. **Time-Slicing (GPU Time Multiplexing)**

**üîç Description:**  
Allows multiple pods to run on the same GPU by giving them **time-shared access** (only one pod at a time gets exclusive GPU access, in rotation).

**üõ† How It Works:**
- The GPU driver or a device plugin enforces scheduling of access in slices.
- No actual hardware-level partitioning; it's a form of cooperative multitasking.

**‚úÖ Pros:**
- Simple to implement.
- Compatible with standard CUDA tools.

**‚ùå Cons:**
- No performance isolation.
- Difficult to predict job timings.

**üîß Vendors / Tools Supporting:**
- **NVIDIA MPS** (Multi-Process Service): For workloads like inference with shared context.
- **KubeShare** (by MIT): Academic, allows fair time-sharing across users.
- **gpushare-scheduler-extender**: Maintained by Alibaba Cloud for sharing with minimal runtime interference.

### üß© 2. **Device-Level Partitioning (vGPU / MIG)**

**üîç Description:**  
Splits a physical GPU into **virtual GPUs (vGPUs)** or **Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) instances**, each with isolated memory and compute.

**üõ† How It Works:**
- GPU hardware supports segmentation into isolated logical units.
- Kubernetes recognizes these segments as separate resources (via device plugin).

**‚úÖ Pros:**
- Strong workload isolation.
- Predictable performance.

**‚ùå Cons:**
- Requires compatible GPUs (e.g., A100 for MIG).
- More complex setup.

**üîß Vendors / Tools Supporting:**
- **NVIDIA MIG** (Ampere & newer GPUs):
  - Supported via the [NVIDIA Device Plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin)
- **NVIDIA vGPU** (requires licensing):
  - Supports strict partitioning and QoS.
- **Bitfusion by VMware** (now EOL): Used to support slicing via ESXi.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **Custom Device Plugins (Memory-Based Sharing)**

**üîç Description:**  
Defines a fraction of GPU memory or resources as a Kubernetes resource (e.g., `gpu-mem=2Gi`).

**üõ† How It Works:**
- A custom device plugin registers fractional GPU resources.
- Pods request partial memory or compute units.

**‚úÖ Pros:**
- High utilization when workloads don't need full GPU.
- Configurable resource fractions.

**‚ùå Cons:**
- Poor performance isolation.
- Must be matched to workload characteristics.

**üîß Vendors / Tools Supporting:**
- **Alibaba Cloud GPU Sharing Plugin**:
  - Allows memory-based sharing.
  - GitHub: [alibaba/kubernetes-gpushare](https://github.com/AliyunContainerService/gpushare-device-plugin)
- **Volcano + kube-batch** (GPU-aware batch scheduler):
  - Supports fine-grained GPU scheduling.
- **Fluid** (Tencent & CNCF sandbox): Cache-aware scheduling, supports GPU locality.

## üß™ Use Cases for GPU Sharing

| Use Case         | Recommended Sharing Method   |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Inference        | Time-Slicing or Memory Sharing |
| Training (small) | MIG/vGPU                     |
| Training (large) | Exclusive access (no sharing)|
| Education        | Memory or time sharing       |
| Multi-tenancy    | MIG/vGPU                     |
