### 🔹 **Short Answer**

Kubernetes **Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)** and **NVIDIA’s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG)** are **complementary**, not replacements.  
They solve **different layers** of the GPU resource-sharing problem — and when combined, they give you much finer control and better utilization.

### 🔹 **Layered Comparison**

|Layer|Component|What It Does|Analogy|DRA Relationship|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Hardware partitioning**|**NVIDIA MIG**|Splits a single physical GPU (e.g. an A100 or H100) into multiple isolated GPU “instances” (e.g. 1g.10gb, 2g.20gb). Each behaves like a small, independent GPU.|Like dividing a physical CPU into hardware “cores” with dedicated VRAM.|DRA can _request and schedule_ these MIG instances, but doesn’t replace them.|
|**Kubernetes orchestration layer**|**DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation)**|Defines a **standard Kubernetes API** (CRDs like `ResourceClaim` and `ResourceClass`) for **dynamic, pluggable resource allocation** beyond CPU/memory — e.g. GPUs, FPGAs, SmartNICs.|Like a broker between Pods and device drivers.|Works _on top of_ or _alongside_ MIG — DRA plugins can expose MIG instances as allocatable resources.|
|**Vendor integration layer**|**NVIDIA GPU Operator / DRA Plugin**|Implements the DRA API for NVIDIA GPUs, including MIG awareness, time-slicing, and device plugin lifecycle.|The “translator” between Kubernetes and GPU hardware.|Required for DRA to talk to MIG-capable devices.|

### 🔹 **How They Work Together**

When used together in a modern Kubernetes setup (like your `tokyo` cluster with NVIDIA GPU Operator):

1. **GPU Operator enables MIG** on the GPU nodes (`miami` and `obsidian`).
2. MIG partitions the GPU into several **MIG devices** (e.g., `nvidia.com/mig-1g.10gb`).
3. The **NVIDIA DRA plugin** registers each MIG instance as an allocatable resource.
4. When a Pod requests GPU via a **`ResourceClaim`**, the DRA framework dynamically assigns a MIG instance that matches the Pod’s needs.
5. Kubernetes handles scheduling and lifecycle via DRA — **without static device plugin allocations**.

This combination yields:

- **Fine-grained GPU slicing** (via MIG)
- **Dynamic allocation & cleanup** (via DRA)
- **Better isolation & utilization** (no more static GPU binding)
- **Future-proof extensibility** (same DRA model can apply to NICs, FPGAs, storage, etc.)

---

### 🔹 **Without DRA**

- You’d rely on static device plugin allocation (`nvidia.com/gpu: 1`).
- MIG devices could still be used, but **you must predefine how many MIG slices exist**, and Kubernetes can’t dynamically create or reallocate them.
- No central API to claim/release GPU slices at runtime.

### 🔹 **Without MIG**

- DRA can still allocate whole GPUs or virtual/time-sliced GPUs (using NVIDIA’s `time-slicing` mode).
- You gain flexibility in scheduling, but lose **hardware-level isolation** and predictable QoS.

### 🔹 **Summary**

| Aspect          | MIG                     | DRA                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Hardware partitioning   | Dynamic allocation & orchestration  |
| **Scope**       | NVIDIA GPUs only        | Any device (generic framework)      |
| **Isolation**   | Strong (hardware-level) | Depends on underlying device/plugin |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed slices            | Dynamic claims/releases             |
| **Relation**    | Hardware foundation     | Orchestration layer built on top    |

### 🔹 **TL;DR**

> ✅ **MIG = how GPUs are sliced**  
> ✅ **DRA = how Kubernetes assigns those slices to Pods**  
> 🔄 **They’re designed to work together**, not replace one another.
