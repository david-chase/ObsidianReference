Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

- Define workflows where each step is a container.
- Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.

Argo is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/) graduated project.

## Why Argo Workflows?[¶](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#why-argo-workflows "Permanent link")

- Argo Workflows is the most popular workflow execution engine for Kubernetes.
- Light-weight, scalable, and easier to use.
- Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
- Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
