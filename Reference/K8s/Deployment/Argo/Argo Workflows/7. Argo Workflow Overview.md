Each Step and DAG causes the generation of a Pod which comprises three containers:

- init: a template that contains an init container that performs initialization tasks. In this case, it echoes a message and sleeps for 30 seconds, but you can replace these commands with your actual initialization steps.
- main: a template contains the main container that executes the primary process once the initialization is complete.
- wait: a container that executes tasks such as clean up, saving off parameters, and artifacts.
