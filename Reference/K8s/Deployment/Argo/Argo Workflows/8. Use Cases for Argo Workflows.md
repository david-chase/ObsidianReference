Argo Workflows is a versatile tool with a wide range of use cases in the context of Kubernetes and containerized environments. Here are some common use cases where Argo Workflows can be beneficial:

- To orchestrate end-to-end **data processing pipelines**, including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tasks.
- In **machine learning projects**, Argo Workflows can orchestrate tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Argo Workflows can serve as the foundation for **continuous integration and continuous deployment** (CI/CD) pipelines. It enables the automation of building, testing, and deploying applications in a Kubernetes environment.
- For **batch processing** and periodic tasks, Argo Workflows can be configured to run at specified intervals or based on cron schedules. This is useful for automating routine tasks, report generation, and other scheduled jobs.
