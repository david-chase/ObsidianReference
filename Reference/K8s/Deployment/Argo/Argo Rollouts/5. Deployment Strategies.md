Every software system is different, and deploying complex systems oftentimes requires additional steps and checks. This is why different deployment strategies emerged over time to manage the process of deploying new software versions in a production environment.

These strategies are an integral part of DevOps practices, especially in the context of CI/CD workflows. The choice of a deployment strategy can significantly impact the availability, reliability, and user experience of a software application or software service.

On the following pages, we will present the four most important deployment strategies and discuss their impact on user experience during deployment:

- Recreate/fixed deployment
- Rolling update
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary deployment

# Recreate/Fixed Deployment

A Recreate deployment deletes the old version of the application before bringing up the new version. As a result, this ensures that two versions of the application never run at the same time, but there is downtime during the deployment. This strategy is also supported by the Kubernetes Deployment object.

> **Distribution of old and new versions using the fixed deployment strategy**

# Rolling Update

A Rolling Update slowly replaces the old version with the new version. As the new version comes up, the old version is scaled down in order to maintain the overall count of the application. This reduces downtime and risk as the new version is gradually deployed. This is the default strategy of the Kubernetes Deployment object.

# Blue-Green Deployment

A blue-green deployment (sometimes referred to as a red/black) has both the new and old versions of the application deployed at the same time. During this time, only the old version of the application will receive production traffic. This allows the developers to run tests against the new version before switching the live traffic to the new version. Once the new version is ready and tested, the traffic is switched (often at the load balancer level) from the old environment to the new one. The advantage here is a quick rollback in case of issues and minimal downtime during deployment.

An important drawback of a blue-green deployment is, that twice the amount of instances is created during the time of the deployment. This is a common show-stopper for this pattern.

# Canary Deployment

A small subset of users are directed to the new version of the application while the majority still use the old version. Based on the feedback and performance of the new version, the deployment is gradually rolled out to more users. This reduces risk by affecting a small user base initially, allows for A/B testing and real-world feedback.
