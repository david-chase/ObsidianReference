Progressive delivery is often described as an evolution of continuous delivery. It focuses on releasing updates of a product in a controlled and gradual manner, thereby reducing the risk of the release, typically coupling automation and metric analysis to drive the automated promotion or rollback of the update.

Progressive Delivery Features

- Canary releases
    
    Gradually roll out the change to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire user base.
    
- Feature flags
    
    Control who gets to see what feature in the application, allowing for selective and targeted deployment.
    
- Experiments & A/B testing
    
    Test different versions of a feature with different segments of the user base.
    
- Phased rollouts
    
    Slowly roll out features to incrementally larger segments of the user base, monitoring and adjusting based on feedback.
    

The primary goal of Progressive Delivery is to reduce the risk associated with releasing new features and to enable faster iteration by getting early feedback from users.
