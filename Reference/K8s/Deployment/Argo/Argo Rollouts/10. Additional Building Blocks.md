While the Argo Rollouts Controller and the corresponding Rollout resource are the core components, there are further building blocks that enable and extend the functionality of Argo Rollouts.

Let's learn more about them.

# Ingress and Service Resources

Relevant Resources for Traffic Routing

- Kubernetes Ingress
    
    A Kubernetes Ingress is a Kubernetes native resource that manages external access to services in a cluster (typically via HTTP). An Ingress allows defining rules for inbound connections to reach cluster-internal Kubernetes Services. As such, they are an important abstraction to programmatically control the flow of incoming network traffic. They can even be used for SSL/TLS termination.
    
- Kubernetes Service
    
    A Kubernetes Service is a resource that abstracts how to expose an application running on a set of Pods. Services can load-balance traffic and provide service discovery within the cluster. The primary role of a Service is to provide a consistent IP address and port number for accessing the running application, irrespective of the changes in the pods.
    
    In the context of Argo Rollouts, these resources play a pivotal role when it comes to, for example, canary deployments. The general behavior of Service and Ingress resources is no different when used with Argo. Argo Rollouts uses Kubernetes Services to manage traffic flow to different versions of an application during a rollout process and they do so by augmenting the service with additional metadata.
    
- Pod Template Hash
    
    Argo Rollouts utilizes the Pod Template Hash, which uniquely identifies Pods of a common ReplicaSset. So to switch incoming traffic from the “old” ReplicaSet to our new ReplicaSet, the Argo Rollouts controller mutates the Service **spec.selector** to match the new Pod Template Hash.

    **Kubernetes Services have selectors that find matching pods according to their label set;** **the pod-template-hash label is added to every ReplicaSet and used to make routing decisions**
    
- Stable/Canary ReplicaSets
    
    By introducing a “stable service” and “canary services” in the Rollouts Spec, Argo can not only switch the traffic to Stable/Canary ReplicaSets, but also decide about the distribution of which ReplicaSet should receive how much traffic.
