Here, we will explore the Argo Rollouts resource, which is the central element in Argo Rollouts, enabling advanced deployment strategies. A Rollout, in essence, is a Kubernetes resource that closely mirrors the functionality of a Kubernetes Deployment object. However, it steps in as a more advanced substitute for Deployment objects, particularly in scenarios demanding intricate deployment of progressive delivery techniques.

# Key Features of Argo Rollouts

Argo Rollouts outshine regular Kubernetes Deployments with several enhanced features.

Argo Rollouts Functionalities

- Blue-green deployments
    
    This approach minimizes downtime and risk by switching traffic between two versions of the application.
    
- Canary deployments
    
    Gradually roll out changes to a subset of users to ensure stability before full deployment.
    
- Advanced traffic routing
    
    Integrates seamlessly with ingress controllers and service meshes, facilitating sophisticated traffic management.
    
- Integration with metric providers
    
    Offers analytical insights for blue-green and canary deployments, enabling informed decisions.
    
- Automated decision making
    
    Automatically promote or roll back deployments based on the success or failure of defined metrics.
    

The Rollout resource is a custom Kubernetes resource introduced and managed by the **Argo Rollouts Controller**. This Kubernetes controller monitors resources of type Rollout and ensures that the described state will be reflected in the cluster.

The Rollout resource maintains high compatibility with the conventional Kubernetes Deployment resource but is augmented with additional fields. These fields are instrumental in governing the phases, thresholds, and methodologies of advanced deployment approaches, such as canary and blue-green strategies.

It’s crucial to understand that the Argo Rollouts controller is attuned exclusively to changes in Rollout resources. It remains inactive for standard deployment resources. Consequently, to use the Argo Rollouts for existing Deployments, a migration from traditional Deployments to Rollouts is required.

Overall, Deployment and Rollout resources look pretty similar. Refer to the following table to understand the minimal differences between both.
