Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI, ensuring the software can be reliably released anytime. It involves the automation of the entire software release process.

CD Features

- Automated release process
    
    Every change that passes the automated tests can be released to production through an automated process.
    
- Reliable deployments
    
    Ensure that the software is always in a deployable state.
    
- Rapid release cycles
    
    Facilitate frequent and faster release cycles.
    
- Close collaboration between teams
    
    A close alignment between development, QA, and operations teams is required.
    

The objective of Continuous Delivery is to establish a process where software deployments become predictable, routine, and can be executed on demand.
