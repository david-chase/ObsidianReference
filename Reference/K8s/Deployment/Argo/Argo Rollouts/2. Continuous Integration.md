Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository, preferably several times daily. Each integration is then verified by an automated build and automated tests.

CI Features

- Frequent code commits
    
    Encourage developers to often integrate their code into the main branch, reducing integration challenges.
    
- Automated tests
    
    Cover frequent code commits. Automatically running tests on the new code to ensure it integrates well with the existing codebase. This does not only include unit tests, but also any other higher-order testing method, such as integration- or end-to-end tests.
    
- Immediate problem detection
    
    Allows for quick detection and fixing of integration issues.
    
- Reduced integration problems
    
    Help to minimize the problems associated with integrating new code.
    

The main goal of CI is to provide rapid feedback so that if a defect is introduced into the code base, it is identified and corrected as soon as possible.

Once code is in our main branch, it is **not deployed** in production or **even released**. This is where the concept of Continuous Delivery comes into play.
