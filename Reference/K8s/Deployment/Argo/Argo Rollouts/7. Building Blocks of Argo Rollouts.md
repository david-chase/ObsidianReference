In this section, we will discuss the building blocks of Argo Rollouts. To give you an overview of what to expect, we’ll briefly describe the relevant components of an Argo Rollouts setup before we discover them in more detail.

Argo Rollouts Components

- Argo Rollouts Controller
    
    An operator that manages Argo Rollout Resources. It reads all the details of a rollout (and other resources) and ensures the desired cluster state.
    
- Argo Rollout Resource
    
    A [custom Kubernetes resource](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/specification/) managed by the Argo Rollouts Controller. It is largely compatible with the native Kubernetes Deployment resource, adding additional fields that manage the stages, thresholds, and techniques of sophisticated deployment strategies, including canary and blue-green deployments.
    
- Ingress
    
    The [Kubernetes Ingress resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) is used to enable traffic management for various traffic providers such as service meshes (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) or Ingress Controllers (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller).
    
- Service
    
    Argo Rollouts utilizes the [Kubernetes Service resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) to redirect ingress traffic to the respective workload version by adding specific metadata to a Service.
    
- ReplicaSet
    
    Standard [Kubernetes ReplicaSet resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) used by Argo Rollouts to keep track of different versions of an application deployment.
    
- AnalysisTemplate and AnalysisRun
    
    Analysis is an optional feature of Argo Rollouts and enables the connection of Rollouts to a monitoring system. This allows automation of promotions and rollbacks. To perform an analysis an AnalysisTemplate defines a metric query and their expected result. If the query matches the expectation, a Rollout will progress or rollback automatically, if it doesn’t. An AnalysisRuns is an instantiation of an AnalysisTemplate (similar to Kubernetes Jobs).
    
- Metric Providers
    
    Metric providers can be used to automate promotions or rollbacks of a rollout. Argo Rollouts provides native integration for popular metric providers such as Prometheus and other monitoring systems.
    

Please note, that not all of the mentioned components are mandatory to every Argo Rollouts setup. The usage of Analysis resources or metric providers is entirely optional and relevant for more advanced use cases.
