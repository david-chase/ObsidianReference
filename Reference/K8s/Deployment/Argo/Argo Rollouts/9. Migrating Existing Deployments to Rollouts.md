The similarity of Deployments and Rollouts spec makes it easier to convert from one to the other resource type. Argo Rollouts supports a great way to migrate existing Deployment resources to Rollouts.

By providing a **spec.workloadRef** instead of **spec.template** a Rollout can refer to a Deployments template:

**apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1  
kind: Rollout  
metadata:  
  name: nginx-rollout  
spec:  
  replicas: 3  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: nginx  
  workloadRef:  
    apiVersion: apps/v1  
    kind: Deployment  
    name: nginx-deployment  
[...]**

The Rollout will fetch the template information from the Deployment (in our example named **nginx-deployment**) and start the in the Rollout specified number of pods.  

Please note, that lifecycles of Deployment and Rollouts are distinct and managed by their respective controllers. This means that the Kubernetes Deployment controller will not start to manage Pods created by the Rollout. Also, the Rollout will not start to manage pods that are controlled by the Deployment.

This enables a zero-downtime introduction of Argo Rollouts to your existing cluster. It furthermore makes experimentation with multiple deployment scenarios possible.

# Discussion: Create Rollouts or Reference Deployments from Rollouts?

As Rollout resources can exist and operate without vanilla Deployments, the following question might arise: Should I always reference Deployments or is it better to start over with an independent Rollout resource, without the dependency of a reference?

And the simple answer to it is… it depends.

Generally, **workloadRef** has been invented to enable a simple and seamless way of migrating from Deployments to Rollouts. We even consider it useful as Administrators who are unfamiliar with Argo Rollouts might be confused if they see an array of Pods running but neither a running Deployment nor StatefulSet. To lower the barrier, referencing existing Deployments from a Rollout can be a good option.

If you use Deployment referencing, the Argo controller will copy the generation number of the referenced Deployment and stores it in a status field called **workloadObservedGeneration**. Therefore the rollouts own **rollout.argoproj.io/workload-generation** annotation should always match the generation of the deployment. This helps to identify deviation due to manipulation of either of the resources.

However, referencing comes at the cost of another resource dependency. Yet another resource to check in case of failure!

So, if you are sure you want to work with Argo Rollouts, use the native Rollout Resource.

Hint: It is also possible to migrate a Rollout resource to a native Deployment. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/migrating/#convert-rollout-to-deployment) for further information.
