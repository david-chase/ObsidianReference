In summary, deployment strategies are fundamental in modern software development and operations for ensuring smooth, safe, and efficient software releases. They cater to the need for balancing rapid deployment with the stability and reliability of production environments.  

**Table 5.1: Benefits of Introducing Deployment Strategies**

| Benefit               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Risk mitigation       | They allow for safer deployments by reducing the risk of introducing bugs or performance issues into the production environment. Strategies like canary deployments enable gradual exposure to new changes. |
| User experience       | Maintaining a consistent and high-quality user experience is essential. Strategies like blue-green deployments minimize downtime and potential disruptions to the user experience.                          |
| Feedback and testing  | They provide a framework for gathering real-world user feedback. Canary deployments, in particular, are valuable for understanding how changes perform in a live environment.                               |
| Rollback capabilities | In case new versions have critical issues, strategies like blue-green deployments allow for quick rollbacks to the previous stable version.                                                                 |

**Table 5.2: Common Use Cases for Each Strategy**

| Strategy              | Supported By      | Common Use Cases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed deployment      | Kubernetes Native | - The most basic way to deploy a workload is whenever downtime is acceptable.<br>- Often stateful workloads (e.g., Databases) require a “recreation” to avoid data corruption.                                                                                                                                                |
| Rolling update        | Kubernetes Native | - Commonly used for stateless, low-maintenance workloads like proxies, RESTful APIs, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Blue-green deployment | Argo Rollouts     | - Use when a) you can afford the extra cost of running twice the resources and b) need a quick and easy rollback option.<br>- B/G can also be helpful for experimentation scenarios.<br>- Can be advantageous to update services that depend on stateful connections, e.g., via WebSockets.                                   |
| Canary deployment     | Argo Rollouts     | - Use it whenever a partial rollout is desirable (experimentation with a subset of users, desire a gradual rollout over hours or days, want to make rollout dependent on certain conditions).<br>- It can be a good alternative if the deployments are too large and the infra cost of running a full blue-green is too high. |
