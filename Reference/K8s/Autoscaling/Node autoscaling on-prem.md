# Node Autoscaling for On-Prem Kubernetes

**Q: Is node autoscaling available for on-prem Kubernetes?**

**A:**  
Yes, node autoscaling is available for on-prem Kubernetes, but it requires some additional setup since cloud providers usually handle it automatically. Here are the key options:

## 1. Cluster Autoscaler (CA)
- The [Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) can work with on-prem Kubernetes if integrated with a provisioning system.
- You need to configure it with an API or script that provisions and removes nodes dynamically.
- This typically requires tools like **Terraform, Ansible, or custom scripts** to add/remove nodes from the cluster.

## 2. Karpenter
- [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/) is another autoscaling solution that can work with on-prem infrastructure.
- It provides more flexibility than Cluster Autoscaler and can work with different node provisioning systems.

## 3. KubeVirt or Virtual Machine-Based Scaling
- If your on-prem infrastructure uses virtual machines (e.g., vSphere, OpenStack, Proxmox), you can integrate autoscaling with your VM orchestration system.
- You can use Kubernetes **Virtual Kubelet** to offload workloads dynamically.

## 4. Bare Metal with Provisioning Tools
- If you're running bare-metal Kubernetes, autoscaling is more challenging.
- Tools like **MAAS (Metal as a Service)**, **Tinkerbell**, or **PXE boot with a provisioning tool** can help automate adding/removing physical nodes.
