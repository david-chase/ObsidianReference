Does Karpenter consider pod limits when doing node consolidation?

###### ChatGPT said:

Good question 👍

Yes — **Karpenter considers both pod requests and limits during node consolidation**, but in different ways:

- **Scheduling / bin-packing decisions** (including consolidation moves) are always made based on **requests**, not limits. That’s because requests are the guaranteed reservation the scheduler (and Karpenter) can rely on.
- However, **limits are not ignored** — Karpenter uses them in two situations:
    1. **Pod Density Constraints** – If `requests` are much lower than `limits`, Karpenter won’t try to cram so many pods together that they would exceed their `limits` if they all spiked at once. This comes from respecting Kubernetes’ `NodeResourcesFit` plugin logic.
    2. **Eviction Risk** – When evaluating consolidation, Karpenter checks if moving pods onto fewer nodes would push CPU or memory usage close to `limits`. If so, it may decline the consolidation because it could cause kubelet eviction under pressure.

In short:

- **Primary driver** = pod requests (that’s what consolidation math uses).
- **Safety check** = pod limits, to avoid creating unstable nodes.

Would you like me to show you how to inspect Karpenter’s scheduling/packing logs on your cluster, so you can actually see whether it’s considering limits in practice during a consolidation cycle?

### What is `NodeResourcesFit`?

It’s a **default scheduling plugin** in Kubernetes (part of the Scheduler framework).  
Its job is to decide whether a Pod can fit on a Node based on resource accounting.

### What it checks

`NodeResourcesFit` has two phases:

1. **Filter (hard pass/fail):**
    - Compares **sum of pod requests** (CPU, memory, ephemeral-storage, extended resources like GPUs) against what’s allocatable on the node.
    - If the Pod’s requests don’t fit, the node is filtered out immediately.
    
    👉 **This uses only requests, not limits.**
    
2. **Score (soft ranking):**
    
    - If multiple nodes can host the Pod, `NodeResourcesFit` can score nodes based on how well they would be “packed.”
    - There are different scoring strategies (e.g. `LeastAllocated`, `MostAllocated`, `BalancedAllocation`), and you can configure which one your scheduler uses.

### Where limits come in

While `NodeResourcesFit` itself doesn’t consider limits directly, limits come into play in two ways:

- **QoS class determination** (Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort), which impacts eviction priority when nodes are under pressure
- **Kubelet eviction**: If actual usage approaches limits (especially memory), pods may be killed even though they “fit” by requests.

This is why **Karpenter’s consolidation looks at requests (via `NodeResourcesFit`) but still does sanity checks against limits/usage** to avoid triggering evictions when collapsing nodes.
