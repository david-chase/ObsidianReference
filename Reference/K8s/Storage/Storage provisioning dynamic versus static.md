### Option 1: **Static Provisioning**

- **You manually create `PersistentVolume` (PV) objects** ahead of time.
- These PVs sit around **waiting to be claimed** by matching PVCs (based on size, storageClass, accessModes, etc.).
- Once a PVC matches a PV, it gets **bound**, and that PV is no longer available to other claims.

This is useful when:

- You're managing storage manually (e.g., an NFS share).
- You want full control over the storage lifecycle.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Option 2: **Dynamic Provisioning**

- You install a **StorageClass** backed by a **provisioner** (e.g., local-path-provisioner, CSI driver, AWS EBS, etc.).
- When a PVC with that StorageClass is created and no suitable PV exists, Kubernetes **automatically calls the provisioner** to create a PV.
- The PV is then bound to the PVC.

This is the modern, cloud-native way, and it's typically what most people use in production (especially with cloud or CSI-backed storage).

### **You _can_ have a StorageClass on a statically provisioned PV, but it's optional.**

---

#### üîπ If the PV **specifies a `storageClassName`**:

- Then **only PVCs requesting that same `storageClassName`** can bind to it.
- This is useful if you want to **group or filter** static volumes by class.

#### üîπ If the PV **omits `storageClassName`**:

- It is treated as having `""` (empty string) as the StorageClass.    
- Only PVCs that also request `storageClassName: ""` or omit the field entirely can bind to it.

#### üîπ If a PVC requests a StorageClass **that doesn't match any static PVs**:

- Then no binding will occur.
- If dynamic provisioning is enabled for that class, a dynamic volume may be provisioned instead.

---

### üß† TL;DR:

- Static PVs **do not need** a StorageClass.
 - But if they have one, **PVCs must match it**.
- Be cautious: if your PV and PVC don't agree on `storageClassName`, they won't bind.
