CloudNativePG is a Kubernetes operator designed to manage PostgreSQL clusters in a cloud-native environment. It automates the lifecycle of PostgreSQL databases, including provisioning, scaling, backup, and disaster recovery, following Kubernetes-native patterns. CloudNativePG simplifies deploying and operating PostgreSQL in Kubernetes by leveraging Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and the PostgreSQL Operator pattern.
