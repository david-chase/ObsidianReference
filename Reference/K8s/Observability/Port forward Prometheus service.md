# Prometheus Port Forward Chat

**Dave:** write me a command to port forward my prometheus service so I can connect to it  
**ChatGPT:**  
To port forward your Prometheus service so you can connect to it locally, use the following `kubectl` command:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n <namespace>
```

Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace where your Prometheus service is running. If it's in the `default` namespace, you can omit the `-n <namespace>` part.

After running this command, you can access Prometheus on your local machine by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:9090
```

**Dave:** modify this command where the namespace is called monitoring and the service name is prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus  
**ChatGPT:**  
Hereâ€™s the modified command with the correct namespace and service name:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring
```

This will allow you to access Prometheus locally at:

```
http://localhost:9090
```
