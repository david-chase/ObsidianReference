# Prometheus Metrics Collection for Kubernetes

**User:** We're talking about Prometheus metrics collection for Kubernetes. What does a "series" represent in Prometheus?

**ChatGPT:**  
In Prometheus, a **series** (or "time series") represents a unique combination of:

1. **Metric name** – The fundamental identifier of what is being measured (e.g., `http_requests_total`).
2. **Label set** – A set of key-value pairs (labels) that differentiate different instances of the metric (e.g., `method="GET"`, `status="200"`, `pod="web-1"`).
3. **Timestamps and values** – A sequence of timestamped values recorded for that unique metric and label set.

### Example:
Let's say you're tracking HTTP requests in a Kubernetes cluster. You might have a metric like:

```
http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200", pod="web-1"}
```

Each unique combination of `{method, status, pod}` creates a separate **time series**.

If another pod (`web-2`) starts emitting the same metric, Prometheus records a new series:

```
http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200", pod="web-2"}
```

### Why Does This Matter?
- Each series is stored independently in Prometheus.
- High cardinality (many unique label combinations) can increase memory usage significantly.
- Good label design helps control Prometheus resource consumption.
