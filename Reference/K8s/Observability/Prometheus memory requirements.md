# Prometheus Memory Requirements for Kubernetes

**Question:** We're talking about Prometheus for Kubernetes. How much memory will I need for my Prometheus pod?

**Answer:**

The memory requirements for your **Prometheus pod** in Kubernetes depend on several factors, including:

1. **Number of scraped targets** – More targets mean more data.
2. **Scrape interval** – A lower interval means more frequent data collection.
3. **Retention period** – The longer you store data, the more memory is required.
4. **Query load** – More frequent and complex queries increase memory usage.
5. **Labels & Cardinality** – A high number of unique time series (high cardinality) will consume significantly more memory.

## General Memory Estimates

| Targets Scraped | Metrics per Target | Scrape Interval | Estimated Memory |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| ~100            | ~200               | 15s              | 2-4GB             |
| ~500            | ~500               | 15s              | 8-16GB            |
| ~1,000          | ~1,000             | 15s              | 16-32GB           |
| ~10,000         | ~1,000             | 15s              | 64GB+             |

## How to Determine the Right Size

- Start with **4GB** for small environments.
- Use the **Prometheus `TSDB` memory estimation formula**:
  
  ```
  RAM = (number of active time series) × (bytes per series)
  ```
  - Typically, each active time series consumes about **2-3KB of RAM**.
  
- Monitor memory usage using **`kubectl top pod`** or **Grafana dashboards** and adjust accordingly.

## Scaling & Optimizing

- Use **Thanos or Cortex** for long-term storage instead of keeping everything in Prometheus memory.
- **Remote write** to external storage if memory usage is too high.
- **Tune retention** with `--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d` (adjust as needed).
- **Enable WAL compression**: `--storage.tsdb.wal-compression`.
